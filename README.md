Budget is a toy app that implements a KNN to predict where the expense is being made. It uses the day of the week, the hour of the day and the value of the expense as features to predict the location of the purchase. It's a toy app cause it stores data in the localStorage of the browser. It's not realible or robust. It was made as an exercice (or proof of concept) after a machine learning class.
